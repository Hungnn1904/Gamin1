  - Hoang... if you're hearing this... it means you made it inside. Good
  - I've managed to hack into a part of their old network schematic. This place is
    a maze, and its security system is locked down by a fragmented protocol.
  - You won't be able to open the main door conventionally. You need to find data
    fragments scattered throughout the tunnels to override the system at the Security
    Control Room.
  - Be careful. My sensors are picking up multiple, unusual bio-signatures... they're
    faster and more aggressive than the zombies on the surface. Don't trust the shadows.
